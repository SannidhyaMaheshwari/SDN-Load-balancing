# Markov-Based ECMP Controller – Full Code and Workflow Explanation

This document explains how the enhanced Ryu SDN controller works, featuring dynamic path selection using Markov-style adaptive probabilities based on real-time link utilization.

---

## 1. Topology Initialization

```python
self.network = nx.Graph()
self.network.add_edges_from([...])
```

- A manual topology is defined using `networkx`.
- The graph contains switches and port mappings.
- ECMP paths are calculated between `s1` and `s4`:
  ```python
  self.paths = list(nx.all_shortest_paths(self.network, source=1, target=4))
  ```

---

## 2. Initial Probability Setup

```python
num_paths = len(self.paths)
self.transition_probs = [1.0 / num_paths] * num_paths
```

- Evenly distributed initial transition probabilities for each ECMP path.
- These probabilities will evolve based on traffic conditions.

---

## 3. Packet Handling

```python
@set_ev_cls(ofp_event.EventOFPPacketIn, MAIN_DISPATCHER)
def packet_in_handler(self, ev):
```

- Triggered when a packet doesn't match any flow.
- Extracts TCP 4-tuple from the packet.
- Uses `random.choices()` with `transition_probs` to select a path probabilistically.
- Installs flow entries for the selected path and its reverse.
- First packet is flooded for guaranteed delivery.

---

## 4. Link Traffic Accounting

```python
def update_link_traffic(self, selected_path, packet):
```

- Increases bit count for `('s2', 's4')` or `('s3', 's4')` based on path usage.
- Used to determine link congestion.

---

## 5. Adaptive Transition Probability Update

```python
def update_transition_probs(self):
```

- Every 5 seconds:
  - Computes inverse utilization for each path.
  - Normalizes to form a new probability distribution.
  - Applies exponential smoothing:
    ```python
    self.alpha * old + (1 - self.alpha) * new
    ```

---

## 6. Utilization Monitoring

```python
def start_periodic_utilization_display(self):
```

- Logs utilization of monitored links every 5 seconds.
- Also updates the transition probability matrix.

---

## 7. Flow Installation

```python
def install_path_flows(self, path, ...)
```

- Installs flow rules on each switch along the path.
- `install_rev_path_flows()` is called for the reverse direction.

---

## 8. Safety & Robustness

- Handles path count changes dynamically.
- Validates that paths and transition probabilities are always in sync.
- Skips processing if no valid paths exist.

---

## 9. Prober (Optional)

```python
def Prober(self):
```

- Sends `OFPFlowStatsRequest` to switches 2 and 3.
- Can be used to monitor actual throughput in future enhancements.

# Markov-Based ECMP Controller – Q&A and Example Walkthrough

This document provides interview-style Q&A for the Markov-style ECMP controller, followed by a complete example demonstrating how probabilities and path selection work in practice.

---

## Q1: What is the main purpose of this controller?

**A:**  
To dynamically balance TCP flows across equal-cost paths using a Markov-inspired probabilistic model that adjusts based on real-time link utilization.

---

## Q2: What is a transition probability in this context?

**A:**  
It is the probability of selecting a specific ECMP path when forwarding a new flow. These probabilities are dynamically updated based on link usage and are stored in a vector called `transition_probs`.

---

## Q3: How are the transition probabilities computed?

**A:**  
Each path's utilization is computed, and its inverse (1/utilization) is used as a weight:
- Paths with lower utilization get higher weights.
- These weights are normalized to form a probability distribution.

---

## Q4: What is the role of alpha (α) in the system?

**A:**  
Alpha is a smoothing factor used for exponential moving average. It balances between:
- Old transition probabilities (`P_old`)
- New probabilities computed from current link usage (`P_new`)

Formula:
```
P_updated[i] = α * P_old[i] + (1 - α) * P_new[i]
```

---

## Q5: Why is packet forwarding probabilistic?

**A:**  
To avoid overloading any one path. Probabilistic selection spreads flows across paths proportionally based on current congestion levels.

---

## Q6: Will packets of the same flow follow different paths?

**A:**  
No. Once a path is chosen for a flow (based on 4-tuple), it is installed as a deterministic OpenFlow rule. However, **different flows** may take different paths based on the current probability matrix.

---

## Q7: What happens when the network becomes imbalanced?

**A:**  
The system detects higher utilization on certain paths, lowers their weights, and shifts future flows to less congested paths automatically by adjusting `transition_probs`.

---

## Q8: How scalable is this approach?

**A:**  
It scales well with multiple ECMP paths. The transition matrix and normalization are dynamic, and `random.choices()` can handle many options efficiently.

## Example: 3 ECMP Paths and Traffic-Based Probability Update

Assume 3 ECMP paths:
- Path A (s1 → s2 → s4)
- Path B (s1 → s3 → s4)
- Path C (s1 → s5 → s6 → s4)

Observed link utilizations:
- Path A: 400 Mbps
- Path B: 800 Mbps
- Path C: 200 Mbps

Step 1: Compute inverse utilizations:
```
inv_util = [1/400, 1/800, 1/200] = [0.0025, 0.00125, 0.005]
```

Step 2: Normalize:
```
Total = 0.0025 + 0.00125 + 0.005 = 0.00875
P_new = [0.286, 0.143, 0.571]
```

Step 3: Apply smoothing (α = 0.8):
Assume current P_old = [0.3, 0.3, 0.4]
```
P_updated = [
  0.8*0.3 + 0.2*0.286 = 0.2972,
  0.8*0.3 + 0.2*0.143 = 0.2686,
  0.8*0.4 + 0.2*0.571 = 0.4342
]
```

Result:
- Path A: 29.72%
- Path B: 26.86%
- Path C: 43.42%

Thus, Path C (least utilized) is now more likely to be chosen for upcoming flows.
